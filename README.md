202430_30421 (ST: AI/MACHINE LEARNING): A laboratory for exploring and experimenting with AI/ML prompt engineering techniques.
# AI/ML Prompt Engineering Lab

Welcome to the AI/ML Prompt Engineering Lab! This repository serves as a dedicated space for hands-on experimentation and exploration of prompt engineering techniques for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models.

## Lab Purpose

The primary goal of this lab is to:

* **Experiment:** Develop and test various prompt structures, strategies, and methodologies.
* **Analyze:** Evaluate the impact of different prompts on model behavior, output quality, and efficiency.
* **Share:** Document findings, share insights, and foster collaboration within the prompt engineering community.
* **Learn:** Continuously improve understanding and skills in interacting effectively with large language models (LLMs) and other AI/ML systems.

This lab will cover topics such as:
* Designing effective prompts for various tasks (e.g., text generation, summarization, Q&A, code generation).
* Understanding the influence of prompt components (e.g., instructions, context, examples, personas).
* Techniques like few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency.
* Evaluating prompt performance and iterating on designs.

## Selected Company: VA Department of Transportation

For the purposes of this lab, our prompt engineering efforts will be conceptually aligned with the domain and potential applications relevant to VA Department of Transportation. We will consider how prompt engineering can address specific challenges or enhance capabilities within their industry.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the notebooks, scripts, and documentation within this repository as we build out our prompt engineering knowledge base.
